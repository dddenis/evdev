Haskell evdev library
=====================

See Hackage for documentation on [the core library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/evdev) and [the streamly add-on](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/evdev-streamly).

The [evdev-examples](https://github.com/georgefst/evdev/tree/master/evdev-examples) folder contains a basic `evtest` clone, with the added ability to read events from multiple devices concurrently.
